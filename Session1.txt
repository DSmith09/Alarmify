Session 1:
	- Data Sufficiency Format:
		- 5 Answer choices
			- A, B, A and B, A or B, Neither
			- Statements are facts, they will not lie in the statements
				- They also will NEVER contradict each other
			- Try to branch to specific answer choices based on sufficiency of either Statement 1 or Statement 2
				- For Example, if Statement 1 is true (isolate answer group to A or D and eliminate B, C, and E)
